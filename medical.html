        <h4>About The Client</h4>
        <p>
            MedGadgets is a pioneering manufacturer of devices used for contactless tracking, measuring, and monitoring of vital health parameters. They specifically focus on sleep and recovery for personal wellness, elderly care, and clinical research
        </p>

        <h4>About the Project</h4>
        <p>
            Syncronetics was approached to help develop MedGadgets's health tracking app focused on ballistocardiography. The customer had already developed some portions of their IoT health monitoring solution, but it still lacked some key features like the ability to administer the system and automate work on user requests. Syncronetics has built an IoT solution that collects a wide range of health data, analyzes and displays sleep statistics, and notifies clinicians in case of an emergency. The solution also includes such features as the ability to assess recovery levels of the heart muscles, remotely record patient indicators, and use an API for academic research.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="m-class-section">
        <h4>App Functionality</h4>
        <p>
            Syncronetics crafted a web-based app leveraging ballistocardiography (the app is wirelessly connected to ferroelectric sensors, capturing intricate graphical representations of the rhythmic movements within the human body). The sensor can detect a forceful expulsion of blood into major vessels with each heartbeat and thus analyze heart rhythms and even estimate the power of a heart's contractions. Besides movements, the app also records other kinds of sleep statistics, like respiratory rates.
As a result, this healthcare IoT platform can:
            <ul>
                <li>Collect a wide range of health data;</li>
                <li>Analyze and display sleep statistics based on collected data;</li>
                <li>Notify medical personnel in case of emergency.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
      
      </div>
      <div class="m-class-section">
       <h4>Solution</h4>
       <p>
         Syncronetics IT specialists delivered an app fully capable of analyzing sleep cycles. The resulting IoT-based health monitoring system records many health parameters, such as heart rates, body position, and even convulsions, etc. In addition, it can notify medical staff when necessary. The data itself is highly personalized, thus all the cybersecurity requirements were fully met.
         As a result, this monitoring and tracking solution provides a detailed description of sleep quality and recovery progress. With such data, it is possible to make well-informed decisions regarding daily workouts, meetings, and other important activities.

        <h4>Project Results</h4>
        <p>
            The web-based patient monitoring system successfully records patients' health indicators during sleep, which greatly improves the quality of care provided. Doctors and other medical staff have all the data at their disposal for comprehensive analysis. For instance, night shifts for hospital staff are now much more effective and safe, as nurses are always aware of their patients' conditions and whether anyone needs attention.
Also, the additional calculation algorithms we implemented have made it possible to increase the accuracy of the data received. The system has enabled the customer to process data supplied by 12,000 devices simultaneously.
Having contributed to the customer's plans, Andersen — as a center of tech expertise in IoT solutions and healthcare apps — has developed a software solution that is:
            <ul>
                <li>	Able to assess the recovery levels of heart muscles (crucial for professional athletes, elderly people, and patients with chronic heart diseases);</li>
                <li>	Able to record patient indicators remotely at clinics, with notifications sent to medical staff when needed (e.g. epileptic seizures);</li>
                <li>	Able to further use the API for academic research.</li>
            </ul>
