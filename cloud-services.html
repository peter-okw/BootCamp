            <h4>Microsoft Office 365</h4>
            <p>
                Recommended for small businesses of up to twenty-five users, Microsoft Office 365 is an entry-level cloud option with many benefits.
    Office 365 is one of the world’s most popular cloud solutions for small business. Offering the ability to access your company’s files and data from any device, your workforce will enjoy using the Microsoft applications they know and love with the additional advantage of being able to access them from anywhere over an internet connection.

            <h4>Microsoft Azure</h4>
            <p>
                Microsoft Office 365 is what is called SaaS, or Software as a Service. Azure goes beyond SaaS to become IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service), providing the operating system, computing power and network from which all necessary components are hosted.
    What does this mean for your business? While Office 365 is a managed solution that is more than enough for many small offices, some may have the need for a more customized approach, more server power and more storage. Azure provides a wide range of integrated services that can accommodate a multitude of operating systems, languages, tools and app development capabilities.
    With enhanced virtual capacity, Azure is the choice of many when migrating to a cloud-based infrastructure, as it allows for customized business applications and extended mobile app support. This allows businesses to host complex third-party applications as a service to their workforce and customer base outside of the Microsoft ecosystem.

            <h4>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h4>
            <p>
                AWS and Microsoft Azure are players in the same field, though Amazon has been in the cloud computing business for longer. One of the main differences is that Amazon operates almost exclusively “in the cloud” and does not have the same level of support for hybrid deployments as does Azure. On the one hand, AWS provides more attractive options for those working in an open-source environment, such as web developers; on the other, Azure presents a clear advantage for those committed to a Microsoft application workflow.
    As they are both enterprise-level platforms, the specific features they offer should be your prime consideration when deciding between the two.
    Are you unsure about which cloud solution is right for you?
    No two companies are exactly alike, so nor should the solutions they adopt be. We design your cloud infrastructure to suit the way you do business, matching the right technology to your budget and computing needs.
    Mustard IT offers several cloud solutions, one of which is right for the way you do business. Moving your operations to the cloud serves the dual purpose of lowering your IT costs and increasing your agility across all business functions.
