         <h4>The Challenge:</h4> 
         <p>
        The client is a top ranked barristers chambers for legal advice and representation, based in Holborn, London. As well as tax, a lot of their work involves issues such as trust law, company law and financial services regulation, they have been a client of ours since 2007.
The tax chambers came to us originally as they were looking to migrate their email services from Exchange 2010 to Office 365. Their local files were being stored on a server, and after explaining the security risks and benefits of choosing storage software, they switched over to  Amazon FSx for Windows, Which is optimised for enterprises using Windows-based applications, shared file storage, and on-premises to cloud migrations..
“Before we moved our files over to Egnyte we were nervous that it would cause some downtime or there would be complications”

          <h4>Solution:</h4> 
          <p>
        We implemented a new cloud-based backup system to improve their disaster recovery plan. In case of a ransomware attack it is vital that the backup is stored elsewhere, so files are still accessible even if you are locked out of your computer.
In general, they had taken a proactive stance on cyber security, however they were not fully certified. We prepared them for this certification, and they obtained it through us. It was beneficial for this business due to the industry they work in. It's very important that their data is kept as secure as possible and employees are kept on top of any of the latest security threats.
“Syncronetics Support made the process easy, we just had to sit back and let them take over. We were really impressed!”

      <h4>Result:</h4>
      <p>
        The client was more that satisfied with the results. They appreciate our consistency and reliability.
“We have been clients since 2007 and we have never been let down.”
